This project is the creation of a replica of the Google Homepage. 
It involves deconstructing the original Google Homepage and rebuilding a simple replica.
The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.

This project involves the use of HTML and CSS in order to create a simple replica of the Google Homepage including the Google Logo, a search bar and some other smaller elements

This is one of the first projects under The Odin Project
